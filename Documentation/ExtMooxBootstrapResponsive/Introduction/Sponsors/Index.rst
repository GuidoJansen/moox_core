Choose a MOOX Template on `http://www.moox.org/designs
<http://www.moox.org/designs>`_ on a newly installed TYPO3.

OR

Install MOOX Template Builder (moox\_template\_builder) to create an
own responsive website template with MOOX.

In both ways moox\_core and all needed MOOX Extensions will be
installed automatically.

OR

of course).

… install the Extension - Flux: Fluid Flexforms (flux)

… install the Extension - Fluid Pages Engine (fluidpages)

… install the Extension - Fluid Content Engine (fluidcontent)

… install the Extension - RealURL: speaking paths for TYPO3 (realurl)

… create a .htaccess-File (for RealURL and optional Static File Cache)

… create a robots.txt File (Standard-configured for search engines)

… automatically configure RealURL

… create an AdditionalConfiguration.php to enable our content
controller

… create a sitemap.xml

MOOX Templates will

… copy some folders and contents to the fileadmin-directory (CSS,
Images)

… do some magic

Screen of the Extension Manager after installing moox\_core. You
should see three green message boxes stating the correct installation
