Introduction
What does it do?


MOOX Bootstrap Responsive is the Core-Extension for MOOX. MOOX is a set of Extensions for the TYPO3 CMS. While this TYPO3 Extension provides Responsive Page-Layouts and Content Elements using Bootstrap, it also can be easily extended by other MOOX-Extensions like News & Blog, jQuery Effects and more.

Users manual

Choose a free or commercial MOOX Template (http://www.moox.org/designs) on a fresh TYPO3-Installation.
OR
Install MOOX Template Builder (moox_template_builder) to create an own responsive website template with MOOX.
In both ways moox_core and all needed MOOX Extensions will be installed automatically.
OR
Install moox_core without any template (FE-Output will be ugly of course).

The MOOX Core-Extension will …

… install the Extension - VHS: Fluid View Helpers (vhs)
… install the Extension - Flux: Fluid Flexforms (flux)
… install the Extension - Fluid Pages Engine (fluidpages)
… install the Extension - Fluid Content Engine (fluidcontent)
… install the Extension - RealURL: speaking paths for TYPO3 (realurl)
… create a .htaccess-File (for RealURL and optional Static File Cache)
… create a robots.txt File (Standard-configured for search engines)
… copy some folders and contents to the fileadmin-directory (CSS, Images)
… automatically configure RealURL

After installation, there are a few steps to get MOOX running. Please refer to the Configuration section for more information. 
Alternatively you may order a ready2run plattform on http://www.moox.org/services/hosting 


Administration

There are no administration tasks for MOOX.

 	
Configuration

If you did not import some Pages you should start with a rootpage and include the static templates in following order:
MOOX Bootstrap Responsive (moox_core)
MOOX Main Extensions (like moox_news)
MOOX Content Extensions (like moox_sequence)
MOOX Template (extension_key_of_template)
Now you must configure the Domain and Page Title via Constants Editor (you should also do this on root-level). There are further constants to configure MOOX, but these two are the only necessary configuration options.
You may add one or two Domain Records on you Root-Page to get your project running with and without the www-prefix.
Now select a Page Layout on Root-level and start with your content.

Have Fun!

Known problems

MOOX should only be installed on new TYPO3-plattforms as it is incompatible to following extensions:

- all templating Extensions like Templavoila etc.
- css_styled_content (automatically deinstalled by MOOX Setup)
- some older pibase-Extensions
- most Extensions that generate own FE-Output
